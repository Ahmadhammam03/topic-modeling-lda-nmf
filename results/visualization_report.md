# 📊 Visualization Summary Report

## Generated Visualizations

### 1. 🎯 Topic Words Analysis
**File**: `topic_words_analysis.png`
- Shows the top 8 words for each discovered topic
- Displays word weights/importance scores
- 5 main topics identified: Politics, Technology, Healthcare, Education, Business

### 2. 📊 Topic Distribution
**File**: `topic_distribution.png`
- Bar chart and pie chart showing document distribution across topics
- Based on 1,000 sample documents
- Politics (25%) and Healthcare (22%) are the largest categories

### 3. 🏆 Algorithm Comparison
**File**: `algorithm_comparison.png`
- Compares LDA vs NMF performance across multiple metrics
- NMF shows superior performance in most categories
- LDA offers probabilistic interpretations while NMF is deterministic

### 4. 🔥 Topic-Document Heatmap
**File**: `topic_heatmap.png`
- Shows probability distribution of topics across sample documents
- Darker colors indicate higher topic probability
- Helps identify document-topic relationships

### 5. 🚀 Project Overview
**File**: `project_overview.png`
- Comprehensive dashboard showing:
  - Dataset sizes (NPR: 11,992 articles, Quora: 404,289 questions)
  - Algorithm performance comparison
  - Processing pipeline workflow
  - Topic category distribution

## Technical Details

- **Image Format**: PNG with 300 DPI for high quality
- **Color Scheme**: Professional palette using Seaborn Set2
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with proper sizing
- **Layout**: Grid-based layouts with proper spacing

## Usage

These visualizations can be used for:
